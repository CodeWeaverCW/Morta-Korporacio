# Lethal Company Esperanto Translation

This project is an amateur Esperanto Translation of Lethal Company, using the Latin Translation as a base.

It is currently a work in progress and updates will be continued.

NOTE: This does not include translations of the Terminal. Those are their own text files that have to be generated by a seperate mod. 

## Submit a Translation
Find a missing translation? Check the issues tab before submitting a fix! Translation fixes will be submitted into main branch as I get to it. I'm sure I could do merging or something, that or manually insert them.
When submitting a new translation, please include the relevant lines from the _AutoGeneratedTranslations file of UnityAutoTranslate. The mod is very specific for how strings need to be formatted, and it's best if we just let the mod generate the string to be translated.

##CREDITS
LynxBite, from the Russian Translation team for helping me figure a few things out. Also for giving me an unborked version of the Autotranslate mod.

LudusTranslationis (https://github.com/benjenkinsv95/lethal-company-latin-mod/), for giving me pointer on how to develop the mod, and graciously lending his translation files so I could more easily translate the mod out.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO USE THIS MOD AS A BASE FOR CREATING YOUR OWN TRANSLATIONS! The more languages that this game is playable in, the better! Translation mods are the only thing we have until Zeekers sets up a Crowdin Translation page.
